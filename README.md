# R
Use of the R language

Each of the homeworks shows the use of R and LaTeX. It particularly shows my adequacy as a statistician.

Useful concepts I have learned throughout my statistics classes:

Use of multiple distributions including but not limited to normal, gamma, beta, bernoulli, binomial, geometric, negative binomial, exponential, chi-square and t distributions.

Able to calculate expected values, variance, mean-squared error, covariance, correlation, independence, bias, consistency, likelihood functions, sufficiency, and confidence intervals.

Able to apply concepts such as monte carlo simulations, central limit theorem, sampling distributions, and estimators.
